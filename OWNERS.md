# openSUSE Github Organization Owner Governance

This document explains the road to become, the expected duties of and the way out of openSUSE Github organization ownership.

openSUSE Github organization owners have [complete administrative access](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#permissions-for-organization-roles)
to all projects in the [openSUSE organization](https://github.com/openSUSE/). They are not to be confused with people who have
[administrative access to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization)
inside the openSUSE Github organization. Repositories are self-governing!

## Become an Organization Owner

There is only one prerequisite to become an organization owner. Every organization owner

- *MUST* be an [openSUSE Project Member](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members)

There is only one way to become an organization owner. One of the existing organization owners "sponsors" you into the team. For this to happen the sponsor:

- *MUST* propose the new organization owner to all the existing organization owners (via a pull request, adding account name to the list of owners below)
- *MUST* give all the other organization owners at least one month to approve/object
- *MUST* elevate the new organization owner accounts permissions
- *SHOULD* educate the new owner on how to fulfill their duties

## Duties of an Organization Owner

There are a lot of things that only organization owners can do. 

- *MUST* actively participate in organization owner sponsorship management
- *MUST* actively participate in repository management (manage repository escalations)
- *MUST* actively participate in membership management (org membership, team membership etc.)
- *MUST* actively participate in maintenance of the [organization's profile page](https://github.com/openSUSE/)
- *MUST* actively participate in managing [GitHub Marketplace app installations](https://github.com/organizations/openSUSE/settings/installations)
- *SHOULD* actively participate in managing all the other things only organization owners can do not listed explicitely here
- *SHOULD* help the organizations project admins (if defined) in their responsibilities
- *SHOULD* mentor and guide all member of the organizations projects

## Stop being an Organization Owner

There are two ways to stop being an organization owner.

### Step Down

To step down as organization owner you:

- *MUST* propose the your own removal to all the other organization owners (via a pull request, removing your name of the list of owners below)
- *MUST* give all the other organization owners at least two weeks to convince you to stay

### Inactivity 

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change
over time and they are not expected to be actively contributing forever. However, being an owner of openSUSE GitHub organizations comes with
an elevated set of permissions. These capabilities should not be used by those that are not familiar with the current state of the openSUSE project.
Therefore members with an extended period away from the project with no activity will be removed as openSUSE GitHub Organization Owner
and will be required to go through the initial membership process again after re-familiarizing themselves with the current state.

Activity is measured by the contributions in the last 12 months in one of the following actions in the [github audit log](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#searching-the-audit-log):

- account
- integration_installation
- integration_installation_request
- org
- team
